# Module 1: Fundamentals

Before diving into system design, you need a solid foundation in how computers communicate over networks. This module covers the essential building blocks.

## Topics

1. [How the Internet Works](01-how-internet-works/README.md) - DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, TLS
2. [Client-Server Architecture](02-client-server/README.md) - Request-response, APIs
3. [Networking Basics](03-networking/README.md) - Sockets, WebSockets, protocols
4. [Operating System Concepts](04-os-concepts/README.md) - Processes, threads, I/O

## Why This Matters

In system design interviews, you'll need to:
- Understand latency at each network layer
- Choose appropriate protocols for different use cases
- Reason about connection limits and resource constraints
- Design APIs that are efficient and scalable

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command line

## Time Estimate

4-6 hours to complete all topics in this module.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, proceed to [Module 2: Core Concepts](../02-core-concepts/README.md).
