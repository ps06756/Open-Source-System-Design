# Module 2: Core Concepts

These are the fundamental distributed systems concepts that appear in every system design interview. Master these before moving to specific designs.

## Topics

1. [Scalability](01-scalability/README.md) - Horizontal vs vertical scaling
2. [Availability & Reliability](02-availability/README.md) - SLAs, fault tolerance
3. [Consistency Models](03-consistency/README.md) - Strong, eventual, causal
4. [CAP Theorem & PACELC](04-cap-theorem/README.md) - Trade-offs
5. [Latency vs Throughput](05-latency-throughput/README.md) - Performance metrics
6. [Data Partitioning](06-partitioning/README.md) - Sharding strategies
7. [Replication](07-replication/README.md) - Leader-follower, multi-leader
8. [Consensus](08-consensus/README.md) - Paxos, Raft
9. [Back-of-envelope Calculations](09-calculations/README.md) - Estimation

## Why These Matter

In system design interviews, you'll be expected to:
- Justify your scaling approach
- Discuss consistency vs availability trade-offs
- Calculate capacity requirements
- Choose appropriate replication strategies

## Prerequisites

Complete [Module 1: Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/README.md) first.

## Next Steps

After this module, proceed to [Module 3: Building Blocks](../03-building-blocks/README.md).
