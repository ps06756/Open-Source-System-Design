# Module 6: Interview Strategy

This module covers how to approach system design interviews effectively. Technical knowledge is only half the battle - you also need to communicate well and manage your time.

## Key Principles

### 1. Drive the Conversation
- The interview is collaborative, but you should lead
- Don't wait for the interviewer to ask questions
- Proactively explain your thinking

### 2. Think Out Loud
- Share your reasoning process
- Explain why you're making each decision
- Acknowledge trade-offs explicitly

### 3. Start Simple, Then Iterate
- Begin with a basic working design
- Add complexity as needed
- Don't over-engineer from the start

### 4. Manage Your Time
- 45-60 minute interviews go fast
- Don't spend too long on any one section
- Cover all aspects at least briefly

## Typical Time Allocation (45 min)

```
Requirements & Clarification:  5-7 min
Capacity Estimation:           3-5 min
High-Level Design:            10-15 min
Detailed Design:              15-20 min
Trade-offs & Discussion:       5-10 min
```

## What Interviewers Look For

### Strong Signals
- Clear problem decomposition
- Appropriate technology choices with justification
- Awareness of trade-offs
- Handling scale and edge cases
- Good communication and collaboration

### Red Flags
- Jumping into solution without understanding requirements
- Single-minded focus on one aspect
- Unable to estimate or discuss scale
- No consideration of failure modes
- Poor communication or not taking feedback

## Before the Interview

1. **Practice with a timer** - simulate real conditions
2. **Study common patterns** - they apply across many systems
3. **Know your strengths** - be ready to dive deep on topics you know well
4. **Review recent projects** - you may be asked about systems you've built

## During the Interview

1. **Take notes** - write down requirements and constraints
2. **Use the whiteboard** - draw diagrams as you talk
3. **Check in** - "Does this make sense so far?"
4. **Be flexible** - pivot if the interviewer redirects

## After the Interview

1. **Reflect** - what went well? what didn't?
2. **Fill gaps** - study areas where you struggled
3. **Don't stress** - sometimes it's just not a fit
